<br>It s very interesting to see a game that allows you to explore 3D from such a small perspective; it adds a really cool sense of scale. If, like me, you re disappointed with MSI s level of performance, then this guide will knock the rug out from under you. Based on the original AMD FX-8350. It is an alloy of two cores, each of which has a frequency of 1000 MHz. The 640 MB integrated graphics core Radeon X1600 is good for gaming. The AMD Radeon X1650 PRO is AMD s new flagship based on the previous generation Radeons X16. With 3 graphics cards with 3D support, it can run many games at 60fps or 120fps with excellent visuals. One of AMD s strengths is that it s not just the result of a commercial agreement. The FX809 was developed as a standalone product and was priced at 1000. While being AMD s co-designer, this board is a know-how and is mostly outside the range from which the competition could be accessed. Despite AMD having a Taiwanese campaign and positioning the FX800 as a professional-use platform, perhaps the most expensive of the four, the board was released for around 2,500. As before, the prices of other AMD boards have been increased, and new competitors appear every day that can cover the performance range of FX cards very quickly. The AMD Nano has four GDDR5 Video Memory, which also makes it the best choice. Ever since AMD made the decision to introduce performance enhancements with technology, its power has been known for improving performance over other competitors. A few years ago, graphics card manufacturer Zotac released cards for 3D gaming. The real revolution came in 2010 when the company showed developers amazing speeds for games with DirectX 11 support. Now AM D includes both the FX9800A and the Fx1600 with 1024 MB of RAM. Improved technologies such as Direct3D 11 and OpenGL ES 2.0 and the AMD Phenom II X4 845 processor have helped create a faster system for games and applications. This includes ATHENA graphics cards for gaming PCs. Nano supports AMD graphics with preinstalled [SH9D!]
